In Kubernetes, services play a crucial role in exposing applications running on pods and enabling communication both within and outside the cluster. There are four main types of services in Kubernetes:

ClusterIP Service:
Default type that exposes the service only within the cluster.
Pods can communicate with each other using the internal IP.
Ideal for inter-pod communication (i.e., service-to-service traffic).

NodePort Service:
Exposes the service on a static port on each node's IP at the cluster level.
Allows external access to the service using <NodeIP>:<NodePort>.
Best for simple setups but less flexible for production environments.

LoadBalancer Service:
Creates an external load balancer (typically provided by cloud providers) to expose the service to external clients.
Automatically distributes traffic across the pods running on the service.
Ideal for production when scaling and external access are required.

ExternalName Service:
Maps a service to a DNS name (e.g., maps to an external resource like a database or third-party service).
Allows Kubernetes to proxy requests to external services by using a DNS entry.
These services ensure reliable networking and manage how pods communicate internally and with external clients.
