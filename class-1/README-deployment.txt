A Deployment in Kubernetes is a higher-level abstraction used to manage and control applications. It provides a declarative way to manage the lifecycle of your applications by handling scaling, updates, and rollbacks. Here's a brief explanation:

Declarative Updates: A Deployment allows you to define the desired state of your application, including how many replicas (pods) should be running, and Kubernetes automatically ensures that the cluster reaches and maintains this state.

Rolling Updates: Deployments support rolling updates, allowing you to update your application version without downtime. Kubernetes will update the pods gradually, replacing older versions with newer ones, ensuring continuous availability.

Rollback Capability: If something goes wrong during an update, a Deployment provides rollback functionality, allowing you to revert to a previous version of your application.

Scaling: You can scale your application easily by adjusting the number of replicas in the Deployment. Kubernetes will automatically create or remove pods to match the desired number.

Pod Management via ReplicaSet: Deployments manage ReplicaSets, which in turn manage the actual pods. When you create or update a Deployment, it creates a ReplicaSet to ensure that the right number of pods are running.

In short, a Deployment is the preferred way to manage the lifecycle of stateless applications in Kubernetes, providing robust features like rolling updates, scaling, and rollback.
